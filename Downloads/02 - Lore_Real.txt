Long ago Antumbra thrived as a kingdom of light and laughter.  
Its fields bore endless harvest its halls echoed with joyous song.  
At the heart of it all stood the King of Antumbra beloved yet proud.  
But even kings must kneel to time and deaths shadow stirred his heart.  
In fear of being forgotten he sought what no mortal should desire.
Whispers of forbidden arts reached the kings ears in darkest hours.  
They spoke of emerald fire a flame said to unchain life from death.  
The witches of Antumbra bound to his throne answered his call.  
Foremost among them was the Green Man master of poison and rebirth.  
Together they forged a pact to defy the natural order of the world.
Beneath the palace the ritual began as the stars held their breath.  
Emerald fire rose searing life from the king and binding his soul.  
He was crowned immortal but hollow unfeeling and unbound by time.  
The rituals flames spread cursing every soul beast and stone nearby.  
Antumbra fell that night swallowed whole by its own green fire.
The curse twisted men into monsters and beasts into nightmares.  
Rats festered with venom bats hungered for blood beyond reason.  
Traps once guarding treasure warped to thirst for wandering flesh.  
Even the witches were chained to their own spell becoming wraiths.  
The dungeon itself breathed alive with the heartbeat of the curse.
The Green Man alone escaped the rituals grip carrying bitter truth.  
He wandered into the depths unseen and silent yet watching still.  
He knew the curses source and the means to end its emerald flame.  
But guilt shackled him and fear of the kings wrath kept him hidden.  
Thus the labyrinth remained a graveyard of lost souls and green fire.
Centuries passed and Antumbras name faded to a fearful whisper.  
What was once a kingdom became a dungeon for reckless adventurers.  
Legends spoke of treasures and power for any who dared descend.  
Yet none returned whole and those few who lived bore emerald eyes.  
The curse endured feeding on each life brave enough to enter.
Prophecies whisper of a heart that beats deep beneath the ruins.  
To shatter it would break the curse and free Antumbras fallen souls.  
But to seize it would crown a new immortal binding them to green fire.  
Thus each adventurer walks a path paved with glory or damnation.  
The dungeon waits silent judging the hearts of those who enter.
Deeper halls grow colder and the whispers sharper in their call.  
Emerald light flickers on walls carved with forgotten prayers.  
Monsters grow stronger their hunger sharpened by endless torment.  
The air hums with the weight of lives bound in eternal half death.  
Somewhere ahead the curses master watches and remembers you.
At the dungeons threshold the truth begins to unfold in fragments.  
The kings name erased his face veiled by shadow and green flame.  
The Green Mans secret lies buried waiting for one brave enough.  
Your every step brings you closer to the heart of Antumbras sorrow.  
Beyond the final door fate waits for you and for the cursed king.

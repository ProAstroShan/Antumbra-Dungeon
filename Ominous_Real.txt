The air here tastes of forgotten despair
Whispered echoes crawl beneath the stone
Shadows coil like serpents in the flickering light
A chill grips your soul cold and unyielding
Beneath your feet the earth seems to breathe
Faint screams echo from the darkness ahead
The walls watch you silent and unblinking
Something ancient stirs beyond the veil of darkness
Every step feels heavier weighed by unseen eyes
The silence here is a suffocating shroud
The scent of decay lingers in the stagnant air
Distant clinks of chains rattle in the gloom
Your torch flickers as shadows writhe unnaturally
Time itself seems warped within these cursed halls
A sinister presence slinks just beyond your vision
The ground beneath you hums with eldritch power
Echoes of past victims whisper their regrets
Darkness here is alive watching and waiting
Cold breath caresses your neck but no one is there
The deeper you go the more the dungeon hungers
Bones crunch underfoot but you see no remains
A sudden chill heralds something far worse than death
The walls bleed shadows and the shadows bleed madness
The dungeons heart pulses with a dark hungry beat
Every door is a gateway not just to another room but to oblivion
Your footsteps dissolve into silence swallowed whole
An unseen whisper promises freedom for a price
Eyes glint in the dark but no beast approaches
Time folds back upon itself trapping lost souls
The air hums with the weight of countless forgotten sins
A creeping dread seeps into your bones and wont let go
You feel the dungeons breath cold wet and watching
Somewhere below chains scrape against stone slow and deliberate
The darkness ahead is a void that promises nothingness
Your shadow twists and crawls breaking free from your feet
Forgotten prayers linger here unanswered and bitter
A low growl vibrates through the stones beneath you
The ground trembles something enormous stirs beneath
A faint haunting melody rises from the abyss
The light from your torch is devoured swallowed whole
Eyes blink open in the darkness but they belong to no living thing
